-- The persisted Markov model, one row per symbol per date. Written by
-- train_markov and read (never recomputed) by markov strategies at backtest time.
-- state is 1 bull, -1 bear, 0 sideways. prob_bull and prob_bear are the
-- walk-forward chance that the next bar is bull or bear, from transitions
-- known as of that date. signal is prob_bull minus prob_bear.
