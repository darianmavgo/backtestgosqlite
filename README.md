# backtestgosqlite

Go backtester. Market bars, reference lists, signals, trades, and reports live in SQLite. Build the binaries, then run a command from the repository root so `.env` and the default paths resolve.

```bash
make build          # every cmd/* binary into bin/
make test           # go test ./pkg/... ./cmd/...
make list           # ./bin/backtest -strategylist
```

`go run ./cmd/<name>` is the same program as `./bin/<name>`. Package map and internals are in [Architecture.md](Architecture.md); rules for editing the code are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Pipeline in order

Each command is one stage and answers one question. Run them left to right, or run them all for a set of stocks with [`pipeline`](#pipeline).

| Stage | Question | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Data | What bars do I have? | `market_history`, `universe` |
| Train | Fit the models | `train` |
| Run | How did it do? | `backtest` |
| Tune | Which parameters? | `gridsearch` |
| Validate | Is it real or overfit? | `validate` |
| Score | In and out of sample, with a tier A to D and the deployed ledger | `strateval` |
| Rank | Which is best? | `scoreboard` |
| Go live | What do I buy next session? | `livescan` |

## What it can do

| Capability | Command |
|---|---|
| Download daily, minute and option bars | `market_history` |
| Build the stock and ETF universe (`refdata/universe.db`) | `universe` |
| Backtest one strategy, many, or a shared-cash stack | `backtest` |
| Stack strategies on one cash ledger with `a+b+c`, with leftover cash parked in a symbol (`park-<symbol>`) | `backtest` |
| Rank strategies as idle-cash overlays and build a greedy stack | `backtest stack` |
| Sweep hold, take-profit and stop, then promote winners to new strategies | `gridsearch` |
| Is it real or overfit: walk-forward folds plus a verdict per strategy | `validate` |
| In-sample / out-of-sample ledger with tiers A to D | `strateval` |
| Rank every registered strategy, or a list | `scoreboard` |
| Live signal scan for the next session | `livescan` |
| Research studies (clustering, HMM regimes, lead/lag, decision trees) | `study` |
| Report on an IBKR transaction CSV | `transaction_calc` |
| Covered-call simulation | `backtest covered-call` |

### Strategies

Every strategy is calculated in SQL and run by Go. `backtest -strategylist` prints the counts per family and asks before dumping all of them, about 65,600 today; `./bin/strategy` prints the strategies that have their own pipeline. Where the definition lives:

| Source | Count | Defined in |
|---|---|---|
| Own pipeline | a handful (`voo-up3`, `price-action-reclaim`, `tsll-daily-one-share`, covered calls) | a small config in `pkg/strategy/` plus `sql/strategies/<id>/` |
| Rows in `refdata/strategies.db` | `streak_strategy` 13,136, `hold_strategy` 26,242 (the old hold_bail rows were merged in when the DB was first opened) `tree_strategy` 13,121 (ids `<symbol>_tree`), `markov_strategy` 13,122, `rotation_strategy` 8 (five rank a liquid universe on momentum and hold the top few. `biggest-winner`, `-short` and `-inverse` are period rows: at the start of each calendar `period` (`1d`, `1w`, `1m`, `1q`, `1y`) hold the top `top_k` names by the previous period's return, `side` long, short or the matched inverse ETF; seeded by `sql/seed/rotation_period.sql`) | `pkg/streak_strategy`, `pkg/hold_strategy`, `pkg/tree_strategy`, `pkg/markov_strategy`, `pkg/rotation_strategy`, each running one shared `sql/strategies/<family>/` |

Most streak rows are a generic "drop 3 days, buy the rebound" rule, one per symbol. A few were promoted from sweeps (`source_strategy` `voo-up3`, `gld-decline`, `universe-screen`, `manual`). `streak-voo-buy-tecl` is now `streak-voo-buy-tecl`. `park-<symbol>` resolves for any ticker without registration (see below). The older `streak-voo-buy-tecl`, `gld-decline` and `googl-hop` strategies are no longer registered; their SQL folders remain in `sql/strategies/`.

### Searching for a stack

The search that produced the current numbers, in order:

1. `validate -keep-going` over the candidates on a market DB cut off before a held-out final year.
2. `sql/search/01_gate_walk_forward.sql`: strict out-of-sample gate (at least 30 OOS trades, OOS Sharpe 1.5, 75% positive folds, worst fold drawdown 6%).
3. `sql/search/02_liquidity_returns.sql` and `03_liquidity_screen.sql`: dollar volume, price and split-jump screen. `04_candidates.sql` joins the survivors to their trade symbols. Run these with `sqlite3`, attaching the walk-forward DB (`wf`), market DB (`mkt`) and `refdata/strategies.db` (`ref`).
4. `backtest stack` over the survivors for several primaries and `-alloc` sizes.
5. Re-run the frozen stacks on the held-out year with `-start`.

Shortcut for steps 4 and 5: `./bin/stackopt -candidates-file ids.txt -max-dd 0.10` picks sleeves one at a time by the stack's own CAGR while the stack's max drawdown stays under `-max-dd`, selecting on data before the holdout (`-holdout-months`, default 12), then runs the held-out months once. It writes `<run>/stack.db` and `<run>/oos/stack.db`; `-name "My Stack"` saves the result in the `stack` table. Other flags: `-alloc`, `-capital`, `-min-gain`, `-max-sleeves`, `-start`, `-concurrency`, `-out-dir`. It drops tree strategies listed by `train check` unless `-allow-leaks` is given.

`./bin/train check` lists models trained on bars after the holdout cutoff (today: trees; markov is walk-forward by construction) and saves them to `training_leak` in `data/reports/training_leaks.db`. `-fix` retrains each through the cutoff; a symbol without enough pre-cutoff history stays on the list.

Every `backtest` and `backtest stack` run now does step 5 itself (see the holdout note under `backtest`). Result to date: no stack reached 79% CAGR with drawdown under 6%. Liquid stacks held a Calmar of about 4 to 8 in-sample and about 4.5 on the holdout. The benchmark to beat is in [docs/omnifunds_benchmark.md](docs/omnifunds_benchmark.md).

## Create and polish a strategy: GOOGL walkthrough

Every command in this repo, in the order you use them to take one idea from raw bars to a live signal. `pipeline` runs all of these for you in one scoped run, and `scripts/googl_pipeline.sh` is the GOOGL example. The example is GOOGL, using the rows that already exist in `refdata/strategies.db`: `streak-googl-down3`, `streak-googl-down3-googl`, `googl_tree`, `markov_model_googl` and `markov_hmm_googl`. Swap in another ticker the same way. Flags go before positional ids. Steps 2, 3, 17 and 18 are optional; the rest are the path.

| # | Stage | Command | What it does for GOOGL | Reads / writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Get data | `./bin/market_history GOOGL VOO SGOV -years 6` | Downloads daily bars for the signal symbol, a benchmark and a cash park. Run again to fill new sessions. | writes `data/market_history.db` |
| 2 | Find symbols (optional) | `./bin/universe -stocks-only` | Rebuilds the stock and ETF universe to pick related tickers. Needs `POLYGON_API_KEY`. | writes `refdata/universe.db` |
| 3 | See what exists | `./bin/strategy` then `./bin/backtest -strategylist` | Confirms the GOOGL ids above are registered and shows row counts per family. | reads `refdata/strategies.db` |
| 4 | Explore the idea | `./bin/study -list`, `./bin/study -study hmm_regime -symbol GOOGL`, `./bin/markov_test` | Regime study for GOOGL; `markov_test` prints the bear / sideways / bull matrix and tomorrow's odds. Use `-study googl_market_context` only if a caller supplies a cluster DB. | reads market DB; writes `data/reports/<study>.db` |
| 5 | Train models | `./bin/train markov GOOGL` and `./bin/train tree GOOGL` | Fits the Markov regime table and the depth-3 tree that `markov_model_googl` and `googl_tree` read. `streak` and `hold` have nothing to train. Use `-through <date>` on `tree` to keep later months out of sample. | writes `data/markov_models.db`, `data/tree_models.db` |
| 6 | Pick a list | `./bin/stratlist sql/lists/<file>.sql` | Turns a SELECT on `strategies.db` into ids, for example every strategy whose signal symbol is GOOGL. Feed it to `backtest -strategy "$(...)"`. | reads `refdata/strategies.db` |
| 7 | First backtest | `./bin/backtest -strategy streak-googl-down3,googl_tree,markov_model_googl` | Runs each idea alone: an IN-SAMPLE pass, then one OUT-OF-SAMPLE pass on the last 12 months. Tune on the in-sample numbers only. | writes `data/reports/<run_id>/` (`streak.db`, `tree.db`, `markov.db`, `report.html`, `oos/`) |
| 8 | Look at the grid | `./bin/gridsearch params streak-googl-down3` | Prints the hold, take-profit, stop and regime grid with no simulation. | none |
| 9 | Sweep parameters | `./bin/gridsearch -strategy streak-googl-down3 -top 20` | Sweeps hold, target, stop and regime. The sweep stops before the held-out months (`-holdout-months`, default 12) so they do not tune the result. | writes `data/reports/gridsearch.db`, `<strategy>_gridsearch.html` |
| 10 | Promote winners | `./bin/gridsearch promote -strategy streak-googl-down3 -min-win-rate 0.6 -min-trades 30 -top 5` | Copies the best sweep rows into `streak_strategy` as new ids such as `streak-googl-down3-googl`. | writes `refdata/strategies.db` |
| 11 | Re-run tuned | `./bin/gridsearch apply -run-id <N> -strategy streak-googl-down3` | Re-runs with the highest-resilience sweep row. Compare to step 7. | reads `gridsearch.db` |
| 12 | Walk-forward | `./bin/validate walk -keep-going -strategy streak-googl-down3-googl,googl_tree` | Rolling 24 month train / 6 month test folds, one strategy at a time. | writes `data/reports/walk_forward.db` |
| 13 | Overfit verdict | `./bin/validate verdict -strategy streak-googl-down3-googl,googl_tree` (or plain `validate`, which does 12 and 13 together) | Prints `HOLDS`, `DECAYS`, `CURVE_FIT` or `INSUFFICIENT` per strategy. Drop anything that is not `HOLDS`. | reads/writes `walk_forward.db` |
| 14 | Ledger and tier | `./bin/strateval -strategy streak-googl-down3-googl`, then `strateval report` | Records in-sample and out-of-sample results and a tier A to D (A needs 12 OOS trades, win rate 0.55, drawdown under 0.15). `-optimize -max-trials 50` searches parameters inside the eval. | writes `data/reports/strategies.db` |
| 15 | Stack it | `./bin/backtest -strategy "streak-googl-down3-googl+googl_tree+park-googl" -alloc 0.1` | Shares one cash ledger. `park-googl` (or `-default-asset GOOGL`) holds leftover cash in GOOGL and is never the primary. | writes `data/reports/<run_id>/stack.db` |
| 16 | Find complements | `./bin/backtest stack -primary streak-googl-down3-googl -secondary "googl_tree,markov_model_googl,park-sgov" -stack-depth 3` | Ranks each secondary as an idle-cash overlay, then builds the greedy stack. Rank finalists by Calmar and max drawdown. Beat [docs/omnifunds_benchmark.md](docs/omnifunds_benchmark.md). | writes `data/reports/stack_eval_<primary>.db` |
| 17 | Park-symbol sweep (optional) | `./bin/park_sweep -strategy <ids> seed`, `run`, `rank`, `report` | Runs the listed `streak_strategy` and `markov_strategy` rows (all rows without `-strategy`) with leftover cash parked in GOOGL and ranks them. | writes `data/reports/park_googl.db`, `park_googl.html` |
| 18 | Options overlay (optional) | `./bin/market_history -source polygon-options -symbols GOOGL`, then `./bin/backtest covered-call -symbol GOOGL` | Compares holding GOOGL with selling a monthly call. | writes `option_*` tables; prints to stdout |
| 19 | Rank everything | `./bin/scoreboard -strategy <ids>`, `scoreboard status -strategy <ids>` | Backtests the listed strategies (all registered ones without `-strategy`) that lack a result and ranks them. | writes `data/reports/scoreboard.db` |
| 20 | Keep fresh | `./bin/backtest stale` and `./bin/gridsearch stale` | Lists results made stale by new bars or edited SQL. Rerun steps 1, 5, 7 for those. | none |
| 21 | Go live | `./bin/livescan -strategy streak-googl-down3-googl,googl_tree -json` | Signals for the next session from the last completed bar. `ENTER` means buy next session. `trade_orchestrator` consumes the JSON. | writes `data/reports/livescan.db` |
| 22 | Check real trades | `./bin/transaction_calc -in data/<ibkr export>.csv` | Builds the same performance report from your broker CSV, so live results can be compared to the backtest. | writes `data/reports/<date>/<csv>.html` |
| 23 | Rank in bulk | the `stack-candidates` skill | Runs `train`, `backtest`, `gridsearch` and `strateval` for all families and reports the top 20 to stack. See [Stack candidates skill](#stack-candidates-skill). | uses all of the above |

Notes:

- Steps 7, 9, 12 and 14 must stay on in-sample data; look at the `oos/` pass or the last 12 months only once, at the end. Edit the strategy after seeing the held-out result and that result is in-sample.
- A new idea that is not a row yet: write it as SQL following [docs/strategies/writing_a_strategy.md](docs/strategies/writing_a_strategy.md), or as a `streak_strategy` row ([docs/strategies/streak_strategy.md](docs/strategies/streak_strategy.md)), then start at step 5.
- Command details and flags are in the per-command sections below.

## Paths

`pkg/appenv` reads the environment, then the nearest `.env`. A real environment variable wins.

| Variable | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_FOLDER` | `.` | repository root. `data/`, `refdata/` and `data/reports/` are fixed subfolders of it |
| `POLYGON_API_KEY` | empty | Polygon equity and option downloads, `universe` |
| `STRATEGY_ALLOWLIST` | empty | `strateval` live-list snapshot |
| `STRATEGIES_DB` or `STRATEVAL_DB` | empty | overrides the strateval ledger path (otherwise `strategies.db` in the run folder) |

Default files:

| Role | Path |
|---|---|
| Market bars | `data/market_history.db`, table `backtest_start` |
| Hourly bars (1h) | `data/market_history_hourly.db`, table `backtest_start` (`appenv.HourlyDB`) |
| Minute bars (1m, 5m, ...) | `data/market_history_minute.db`, table `backtest_start` (`appenv.MinuteDB`; not created until minute bars are downloaded) |
| Strategy tables and symbol lists | `refdata/strategies.db` (`streak_strategy`, `hold_strategy`, `tree_strategy`, `markov_strategy`, `rotation_strategy`, and `symbol_lists`: `symbol_list_id`, `list` = comma separated tickers. `etf-pre-2021` is every ETF in `universe.db` first traded before 2021-01-01, from `sql/seed/symbol_lists.sql`. A `rotation_strategy` row whose `symbols` equals a `symbol_list_id` (case and surrounding spaces ignored) uses that list; any other value is a literal ticker list. `strategy export` carries the lists a row names) |
| Stock and ETF universe | `refdata/universe.db`, table `universe` |
| Backtest results | one folder per run, `data/reports/<run_id>/`, numbered 1, 2, 3, … Inside it one database per strategy family (`markov.db`, `tree.db`, `streak.db`, `hold.db`, `builtin.db` for Go-defined strategies, `stack.db` for stacks), the HTML report as `report.html`, and the held-out pass in `oos/` with the same file names |
| Shared-account results | `data/reports/shared_<primary>_<secondary>_….db` |
| HTML tear sheet | `data/reports/backtest_report.html` |

Commands that call `cliutils.GetDefaultMarketDB` (`backtest`, `study`, `livescan`) use `data/market_history.db`. `market_history`, `gridsearch` and `scoreboard` also default to it and `market_history` creates it when it writes.

The Go `flag` package stops at the first bare argument. Put flags before a positional id or ticker. A subcommand is argument 1: `backtest stack -primary …`, not `backtest -primary … stack`.

Daily simulations load rows with `length(Date) = 10`. Minute bars stay in the same table and are skipped by the daily bar query.

---

## market_history

Pull bars into SQLite. Default source is Yahoo, with Stooq as the fallback. Polygon is opt-in.

**Reads:** `refdata/strategies.db`. A name in `-symbols` (or a bare argument) that is a `symbol_lists` id, such as `etf-pre-2021-unleveraged`, is replaced by that list's tickers; the other names are tickers. With no symbols at all it reads table `leveraged_etf` (limit 50), which is empty today, so pass tickers or a list id.

**Writes:** `data/market_history.db`, table `backtest_start`. Option history uses the same DB, tables `option_contracts`, `option_bars`, `option_expiry_scan`. Missing dates are filled; `-force` replaces the range.

| Flag | Default |
|---|---|
| `-db` | `data/market_history.db` |
| `-settings` | `refdata/strategies.db` |
| `-source` | `yahoo` (`polygon`, `polygon-options`, `stooq`) |
| `-target-table` | `backtest_start` |
| `-timeframe` | `1d` |
| `-years` | `4` |
| `-table` | `leveraged_etf` (settings DB symbol table) |
| `-limit` | `50` (only the settings-table fallback) |
| `-otm` | `0,2,5` (polygon-options, percent OTM) |
| `-rate` | `5` API calls/minute (polygon and polygon-options; a 429 waits a minute and retries; `0` = unthrottled) |
| `-unleveraged-etfs` | off. Symbols = every active ETF with leverage `none` in `refdata/universe.db`, most traded first (20-day average volume). `-years` defaults to 2 with it |
| `-status` | off. Downloads nothing: prints how many of the symbols are already pulled, partly pulled or not pulled in the target database, the requests left and the time they take at `-rate` |
| `-universe-db` | `refdata/universe.db` (read by `-unleveraged-etfs`) |

```bash
./bin/market_history VOO IEF GLD
./bin/market_history -symbols PDD -years 6
./bin/market_history -symbols etf-pre-2021-unleveraged -timeframe 1h -years 2 -source polygon -concurrency 1
./bin/market_history -source polygon -symbols VOO -timeframe 1m -polygon-key "$POLYGON_API_KEY"
./bin/market_history -source polygon-options -symbols VOO
./bin/market_history -source polygon -timeframe 1h -unleveraged-etfs -concurrency 1   # hours of runtime at 5 calls/min
./bin/market_history -source polygon -timeframe 1h -unleveraged-etfs -status       # what is pulled, what is left
```

Hourly and minute bars go to `data/market_history_hourly.db` / `data/market_history_minute.db`, and coverage is checked there first, so a rerun asks Polygon only for the missing days. Hourly pulls never fall back to Yahoo.

`-start YYYY-MM-DD` overrides `-years`. `-end` defaults to today.

---

## backtest

Run one strategy, many strategies, or a shared cash account.

**Reads:** market DB (`-db`, table `-table` `backtest_start`). `gridsearch apply` is what reads `gridsearch.db` and calls back into this package. SQL pipelines read `sql/strategies/<id>/` when that directory exists, otherwise the copy embedded in the binary.

**Writes:** `data/reports/<id>.db` (next free `data/reports/<id>_N.db` if the name is taken). Tables `signals`, `trades`, `equity_curve`, `performance_summary`, and when relevant `return_breakdown` and `run_metrics`. HTML at `data/reports/backtest_report.html`. Auto-download (`-auto-download`, default on) writes missing bars into the market DB. Window starts `2021-01-01` (`-start`); earlier bars warm up SMAs only. Capital default `$100,000`. `-download-years` default `5`.

```bash
./bin/backtest -strategylist                    # counts per family, then asks before dumping every strategy (y/N)
./bin/backtest -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl -capital 100000
./bin/backtest -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl,mara_tree
./bin/backtest -strategy all
./bin/backtest -strategy markov                 # every row of one family: streak, hold, tree or markov
./bin/backtest -strategy markov -run-id 7       # continue run 7: strategies already done in it are skipped
./bin/backtest -strategy "$(./bin/stratlist -comma sql/lists/sample_100_per_table.sql)"
./bin/backtest -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl -secondary mara_tree,pdd_tree -capital 100000
./bin/backtest streak-voo-buy-tecl+mara_tree
./bin/backtest -alloc 0.10 streak-voo-buy-tecl+mara_tree+pdd_tree
./bin/backtest -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl -secondary mara_tree -alloc 0.10 -default-asset VYM
```

**Out-of-sample holdout (default).** The last 12 months of history are held out. The main pass runs from `-start` through the cutoff (the last bar minus `-holdout-months`), prints as `IN-SAMPLE`, and writes its usual files. Then the same strategy, or for `backtest stack` the stack it found (park included), runs once on the held-out months, flat at the start, printed as `OUT-OF-SAMPLE` and written to `data/reports/oos/` with an `_oos` HTML file. Select and tune on the in-sample pass only. `-holdout-months 0` simulates all history in one pass; `-end YYYY-MM-DD` ends history earlier. The split is skipped, with a message, when less than a year would be left in-sample. It does not apply to `-strategylist`, `-signals-only`, `stale`, `gridsearch apply` or `covered-call`. Two caveats: single-strategy results in `data/reports/<id>.db` now cover the in-sample window only, and a strategy whose SQL pipeline or tree was fitted on all history can still see the future inside the held-out months.

`-symbol` limits the book to one ticker. `-hold`, `-target`, `-stoploss`, `-max-positions`, and `-alloc` override the strategy config when set (non-zero). `-alloc` is a fraction of equity per position (`0.10` = 10%) on standalone runs and on shared-account stacks. `-default-asset GOOGL` is shared-account only: after each session, leftover cash is bought into that symbol, and a sleeve entry sells it first to fund the order. The result goes to `stack.db` in the run folder, and `shared_account_audit` records the default asset. `-no-reinvest-dividends` pays dividends into cash for total-return strategies. `-force` re-runs strategies that already have a usable result (multi-strategy only). `-signals-only` skips the portfolio sim and scans the live window the same way `livescan` does; it does not stack.

### backtest newrun

Create the next run folder and print only its number, so a script can pass one `-run-id` to every command and keep a whole pipeline in one folder (`scripts/googl_pipeline.sh` does this).

```bash
RUN=$(./bin/backtest newrun)
```

### backtest stale

Print which `data/reports/*.db` results are stale (unknown strategy, newer market bars, or an edited SQL pipeline). No simulation.

```bash
./bin/backtest stale
```

### backtest stack

`backtest stack-eval` is the deprecated name. Rank registered strategies as idle-cash overlays on one primary, one shared ledger. Rankings go to `data/reports/stack_eval_<primary>.db` (table `overlay_rankings`). Pairwise runs do not each write a `shared_*.db`. `-persist-best` (default on) writes one `data/reports/shared_<primary>_<secondaries>_N.db` for the greedy stack.

Default candidates skip duplicate `*-sql` ids, `voo-buy-hold`, `genetic-momentum`, and any strategy that does not name its symbols. Pairs are ranked by added equity; the greedy stack is chosen the same way, not by drawdown. Rank the finalists by Calmar and max drawdown from the persisted DB. `-include-universe` adds symbol-scanning strategies. Pass `-secondary` with an explicit list when the registry holds tens of thousands of strategies; `-db`, `-auto-download=false` and `-out-dir` let a search run on a trimmed market DB without touching `data/`. `-stack-depth` (3) is how many complementary overlays are stacked after the ranking.

```bash
./bin/backtest stack -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl
./bin/backtest stack -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl -secondary mara_tree,pdd_tree -persist-best
./bin/backtest stack -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl -stack-depth 5
```

### Park member in a stack

`park-<symbol>` (for example `park-googl`, `park-sgov`) is a stack member that holds leftover cash in that symbol. It is the same book as `-default-asset`, written as a stack member so it can be named in `-strategy`, `-secondary` and `backtest stack`. It emits no signals, resolves for any ticker without registration, cannot be the primary, and a stack holds one. Combining it with `-default-asset` for a different symbol is an error.

```bash
./bin/backtest -strategy "streak-voo-buy-tecl+streak-fslr-down3+park-googl" -alloc 0.1
./bin/backtest stack -primary streak-voo-buy-tecl -secondary "streak-fslr-down3,streak-penn-down3,park-sgov"
```

In `backtest stack` the park applies to the baseline, every pairwise run and the final stack; it is not ranked as an overlay. Compare parks by running `backtest stack` once per park symbol.

### backtest covered-call

Hold one underlying (default `VOO`) and sell a monthly call. Prints the comparison on stdout. Does not write a strategy result DB.

**Reads:** equity bars and `option_contracts` / `option_bars` in the market DB. Load the chains first with `market_history -source polygon-options`.

```bash
./bin/market_history -source polygon-options -symbols VOO
./bin/backtest covered-call -symbol VOO -otm 2 -commission 0.65 -opt-slip 0.05
```

`-start` defaults to the first rollable month (option history is about two years on the Polygon free tier), not `2021-01-01`.

---

## livescan

Same signal generation as `backtest`, window fixed to the last completed session in the market DB. `ENTER` means a buy for the next session. Refresh failure aborts; it does not scan a stale tip.

**Reads:** market DB, table `backtest_start`. `-bars 0` loads each strategy's minimum history.

**Writes:** `data/reports/livescan.db` (`livescan_status`, `livescan_signals`). `-json` also prints the scan to stdout for `trade_orchestrator`.

```bash
./bin/livescan -list
./bin/livescan -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl,mara_tree
./bin/livescan all
./bin/livescan -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl -json
```

`-auto-download` defaults on. `-download-years 0` derives the window from `-bars` or the strategy minimum.

---

## gridsearch

Sweep hold, take-profit, stop, and the strategy's other axes. One strategy writes HTML. Several strategies share one worker pool and record progress so a rerun skips finished ids.

**Reads:** `data/market_history.db`, table `backtest_start`. `-symbols-from` reads a study DB `etf_compare` view (for example `data/reports/voo_up3_etf.db`) ranked by `rank_cagr`.

**Writes:** `gridsearch.db` (`gridsearch_runs`, `gridsearch_results`) in a run folder, `data/reports/<run_id>/`. `-run-id N` goes back into run N, and without it a sweep starts a new run (`stale` and `promote` use the latest). Single-strategy HTML defaults to `<strategy>_gridsearch.html` in the same folder. `stale` and `promote` take `-strategy` to limit to those ids. `-holdout-months` (default 12, the same window `backtest` holds out) stops the sweep at the in-sample cutoff, so the held-out months do not tune the parameters; `-end <date>` sets the stop date directly and `-holdout-months 0` sweeps all history. What it varies per family is in the `strategy_family_param` table of `refdata/strategies.db` (streak: signal days, hold, take-profit, stop, regime. tree and markov: exits only. hold: nothing. rotation period rows: the calendar period, below). Start date `2021-01-01`. Capital `$100,000`. Allocation `0.65`. Cash yield `0.045`. `-min-trades 5`, `-top 10`. `-max-perms 20000` skips a huge generic grid in multi-strategy mode only. `streak-*` strategies loaded from `refdata/strategies.db` are excluded unless `-include-streak`.

```bash
./bin/gridsearch -list
./bin/gridsearch -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl -top 20
./bin/gridsearch -strategy all -no-html
./bin/gridsearch -strategy voo-up3 -symbols-from data/reports/voo_up3_etf.db -top-cagr 10
```

`-force` redoes a strategy already marked done in `gridsearch_runs`.

`-period 1d,1w,1m,1q,1y` (any subset, default all five from `strategy_family_param`) sets the calendar periods a rotation period row such as `biggest-winner` is swept over. Each period reruns the row's SQL pipeline once and the results are labelled `Period-<p>/...` (column `period` of `gridsearch_results`). Example: `./bin/gridsearch -strategy biggest-winner -period 1m,1q,1y`. It has no effect on other strategies.

### gridsearch params

Print the parameter grid. No database and no simulation.

```bash
./bin/gridsearch params streak-voo-buy-tecl
./bin/gridsearch params all
```

### gridsearch stale

Report which completed sweeps are stale. No new sweep.

```bash
./bin/gridsearch stale
```

### gridsearch promote

Copy winning sweep rows into `refdata/strategies.db` table `streak_strategy`. Each row becomes a strategy id `streak-<signal>-<up|down><days>-<trade>` with the watch symbol, the symbol bought, and the swept hold, take-profit, stop, and regime. Backtest, scoreboard, livescan, and strateval load those rows on the next run.

```bash
./bin/gridsearch promote -strategy voo-up3 -min-win-rate 0.6 -min-trades 30 -top 5
```

Defaults for promote are win rate `0.6`, `30` trades, and `-top 5`. A sweep's own `-min-trades` default stays `5`. `-gridsearch-db` chooses the sweep file. Rows that share an id keep the higher win rate. A NULL `signal_symbol` (sweeps from before that column existed) uses the parent strategy's watch symbol.

The walkthrough for writing a row, backtesting it, sweeping it, and ranking it is [docs/strategies/streak_strategy.md](docs/strategies/streak_strategy.md).

### gridsearch apply

Re-run strategies with the highest-resilience row the sweep recorded in the run folder's `gridsearch.db` (`hold_days` must be set, older rows without it are ignored). It goes back into the run that holds the sweep: `-run-id N` names it, and without it the latest run is used. No `-strategy` means every registered strategy. A strategy with no usable sweep runs on its own defaults and is named in the output. The backtest itself is `pkg/backtest`'s, so the holdout and the result files work as for `backtest`.

```bash
./bin/gridsearch apply -run-id 12 -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl
./bin/gridsearch apply -run-id 12
```

`backtest optimized` is the deprecated name.

---

## park_sweep

Run every row of `streak_strategy` and `markov_strategy` with leftover cash parked in one symbol. The lists, the window, and the results stay in SQLite. The park symbol for the default config is GOOGL.

**Reads:** `refdata/strategies.db` (`streak_strategy`, `markov_strategy`) and `data/market_history.db`.

**Writes:** `data/reports/park_googl.db` (`sweep_config`, `park_asset`, `sweep_strategy`, `strategy_run`). Nothing is inserted into the settings tables, and no per-strategy file is written under `data/reports/`.

```bash
./bin/park_sweep seed
./bin/park_sweep run
./bin/park_sweep rank
./bin/park_sweep report
./bin/park_sweep -strategy streak-googl-down3-googl,markov_model_googl seed   # compare only these rows; put the same -strategy on run, rank and report
```

`-strategy a,b,c` limits seed, run, rank and report to those ids (case-insensitive). Only `streak_strategy` and `markov_strategy` ids qualify, and any other id is printed and skipped. `report` writes `data/reports/park_googl_report.db` and `data/reports/park_googl.html` from the sweep. The database holds every strategy row. The page shows the park buy-and-hold, every done streak, and the 25 Markov rows with the highest edge.

`sweep_config` holds the window (`2021-10-01` through `2026-10-01`), capital (`100000`), and park symbol (`GOOGL`). `allocation_pct` NULL uses each row's own allocation. A symbol that does not cover the window is stored as `skipped`. `run` retries `failed` and `running` rows and leaves `done` rows. `rank` prints whatever is already `done`. `-db`, `-market-db`, `-settings-db`, and `-concurrency` override the defaults.

---

## scoreboard

Backtest every registered strategy that lacks a usable result, then rank them.

**Reads:** `data/market_history.db` (`backtest_start`) and existing `data/reports/<id>[_N].db`.

**Writes:** per-strategy `data/reports/<id>[_N].db` for anything it has to run, then `data/reports/scoreboard.db`. If that file is locked it writes `data/reports/scoreboard_N.db`. Capital `$100,000`, start `2021-01-01`, download horizon 5 years. No `-db` or `-out-dir` flag; both follow `APP_FOLDER`.

```bash
./bin/scoreboard
./bin/scoreboard -force
./bin/scoreboard compile
./bin/scoreboard status
./bin/scoreboard -force -strategy streak-googl-down3,googl_tree   # compare only these (ids, a family name, or all)
./bin/scoreboard compile -strategy streak-googl-down3,googl_tree
./bin/scoreboard -detail 100   # faster bulk run: daily equity curves only for the 100 best by CAGR
```

`-strategy` takes comma-separated ids or a family name (`streak`, `hold`, `tree`, `markov`) and limits the backtests, the comparison table and `scoreboard.db` to those strategies. With a subcommand, put it after the subcommand. `compile` only reads result DBs. `status` reports whether every registered strategy has a usable result and does not write `scoreboard.db`.

`-detail N` (default `-1`: every strategy saves its daily equity curve) saves the curve of only the N best strategies of the run by CAGR, after the bulk pass; the others still save trades, signals and the performance summary, so the ranking is the same. The curve is one row per session, and writing it is the one step of a bulk run that cannot run in parallel (one writer per result database), so `-detail 100` cuts the wall time of a large run noticeably. A strategy without a saved curve can be rerun with `backtest -strategy <id>`.

---

## study

Run one research study.

**Reads:** market DB (`-db`).

**Writes:** `data/reports/<study-id>.db`.

```bash
./bin/study -list
./bin/study -study market_context_20d
./bin/study -study hmm_regime -symbol QQQ
./bin/study -study gain_5pct_frequency
./bin/study -study voo_up3_etf
```

Registered ids: `market_context_20d`, `cluster_5pct`, `googl_market_context`, `gain_5pct_frequency`, `hmm_regime`, `etf_study`, `sp500_lead_lag`, `market_clustering`, `qqq_tqqq_volume`, `voo_up3_etf`, `mara_decision_tree`, `mu_decision_tree`, `march_april_voo_gld_uten`.

`cluster_5pct` and `googl_market_context` need a cluster database supplied in code (`SetClusterDB`). The CLI does not pass one, so those two exit until a caller sets it. `cluster_5pct` also expects `data/gain_5pct_frequency.db` beside the market DB.

---

## strateval

In-sample / out-of-sample ledger. It does not edit `STRATEGY_ALLOWLIST` or live jobs.

**Reads:** `data/market_history.db`, table `backtest_start`. Allowlist from `-allowlist` or `STRATEGY_ALLOWLIST` (comma-separated ids).

**Writes:** `strategies.db` (`strategies`, `strategy_evals`, `deployments`) in a run folder, `data/reports/<run_id>/`, unless `STRATEGIES_DB` or `STRATEVAL_DB` is set. `-run-id N` uses run N and without it an evaluation starts a new run (`report`, `status`, `path` use the latest). `report` and `status` take `-strategy` to show only those ids. Scratch artifacts under `strateval_runs/` in the same folder. Held-out window `-oos-months 12`. Capital `$100,000`. Start `2021-01-01`. Tier A gates: at least 12 OOS trades, win rate 0.55, max drawdown 0.15.

```bash
./bin/strateval -list
./bin/strateval -strategy streak-voo-buy-tecl
./bin/strateval -strategy all -optimize -max-trials 50
./bin/strateval report
./bin/strateval status
./bin/strateval sync-deployed -allowlist "$STRATEGY_ALLOWLIST"
./bin/strateval path
```

`path` prints how to open the ledger. `sync-deployed` snapshots the allowlist into `deployments`. `-sync-deployed` on an eval run does the same snapshot after the eval.

---

## pipeline

Runs every stage for a set of stocks as one controlled run: download the bars, train, backtest, sweep and tune, validate, score, stack, and compare. It calls the same code as the commands above, in order, and keeps the whole run in one folder.

```bash
./bin/pipeline -symbol GOOGL                      # every stage for GOOGL, in a new run
./bin/pipeline -symbol GOOGL,AAPL -skip-network   # two stocks, no downloads
./bin/pipeline -symbol GOOGL -strategy streak-googl-down3,googl_tree
./bin/pipeline -family streak -limit 50 -skip-network -skip park_sweep   # the first 50 streak rows
./bin/pipeline -run-id 17                         # resume run 17 and skip the steps it finished
./bin/pipeline -steps backtest,validate -run-id 17 -redo
./bin/pipeline -list-steps
```

**Scope.** The run may touch only the symbols and strategies it was started with. Without `-strategy` that is every strategy row tied to the symbols (as signal or trade symbol, from `streak_strategy`, `tree_strategy`, `markov_strategy` and `hold_strategy`), and rows the `gridsearch_promote` step writes for those symbols join it. With `-strategy` the list is fixed. The scope is stored in `pipeline.db` and a resumed run reads it back: naming different symbols for an existing run is refused. Every step gets that list, so nothing else is backtested, swept, validated or ranked.

**Run id.** A new run takes the next folder number from `storage.NewRun`, which makes the folder atomically, so two runs never share an id. Inside the folder a `pipeline.lock` file holds the process id, and a second pipeline on the same run is refused while the first is alive (a lock left by a dead process is taken over).

**State.** `pipeline.db` in the run folder has `pipeline_run`, `pipeline_scope` and `pipeline_step` (name, status, times, error). A failed step is recorded and the run goes on. The exit code is 1 if any step failed, and `pipeline -run-id N` retries the failed ones.

**Downloads.** The pipeline downloads only what the scope reads: the run's symbols, every symbol its strategies declare, and each strategy's benchmark (the same `runner.RequiredSymbolsFor` the backtest uses), plus the park symbol when `stack_eval` is going to run. A symbol already in the market database is topped up with the bars it is missing, and one that is current is not fetched at all. Option history is downloaded only for the underlyings of covered-call strategies in scope, which no GOOGL strategy is. Steps with nothing to do for the scope are skipped with the reason printed: `market_history_options` (no covered-call strategy), `study` (no `markov_hmm` strategy), `train` (no markov or tree strategy), and `covered_call`, which only runs when you name it. Naming a step in `-steps` always runs it.

**Steps**, in order, each named like its command: `market_history`, `market_history_options` (needs `POLYGON_API_KEY`), `study` (`hmm_regime`), `train` (markov and tree), `backtest`, `gridsearch_params`, `gridsearch`, `gridsearch_promote`, `gridsearch_apply`, `validate`, `strateval`, `stack`, `stack_eval`, `covered_call` (needs option bars), `park_sweep`, `scoreboard`, `stale`. `-steps` and `-skip` choose some of them.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-symbol` | GOOGL (a resumed run keeps its own) | stocks the run may touch |
| `-strategy` | every strategy tied to the symbols | fixed strategy list |
| `-family` | none | scope to the rows of one strategy family (`streak`) instead of `-symbol`; the symbols are the ones the rows read and trade, the list is fixed, and with no primary the stack steps skip |
| `-limit` | 0 (every row) | with `-family`: only the first N rows by id |
| `-park` | SGOV | park symbol of the `stack_eval` step, downloaded only when that step runs |
| `-primary` | `streak-<symbol>-down3-<symbol>` | primary of the stack steps |
| `-years` | 6 | years of bars to download for a symbol that has none yet |
| `-refresh` | off | download the whole window again for the symbols the run needs, not only the missing bars |
| `-run-id` | 0 (new run) | resume this run |
| `-steps`, `-skip`, `-redo` | all steps | which steps run, and rerun finished ones |
| `-skip-network` | off | leave out the downloading steps |

`scripts/googl_pipeline.sh` is a one-line wrapper for `pipeline -symbol GOOGL`. Not yet in the pipeline: `markov_test` (its logic is still in `cmd/`) and `universe`, `transaction_calc` and `livescan`, which are not part of building a strategy. `hmm_regime.db` is still written to `data/reports/` and shared between runs, because the `markov_hmm` strategies read it from there. `park_sweep` uses its own configured park symbol (GOOGL).

## runview

A local, read-only browser for a run folder: the pipeline steps with their status and timings, every result database with its tables (sort, per-column filter, search across all columns, paging, CSV export), the HTML reports, and a SQL box. The newest run opens first, and a run still in progress refreshes its steps every few seconds.

```bash
./bin/runview                      # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765 on the newest run
./bin/runview -root data/reports -addr 127.0.0.1:9000 -open=false
```

Databases are opened with `mode=ro` and `query_only`, and the SQL box accepts only `SELECT`, `WITH` and `EXPLAIN`, so a run in progress is never touched. It reads only the numbered folders under `-root` and refuses any path outside the run folder. It has no login: keep `-addr` on `127.0.0.1`. The page address holds the run, file and table (`#22/scoreboard.db/scoreboard`), so a view can be bookmarked. **Strategy view.** Click any `strategy_id` cell, or type an id in the header box, to see one strategy's whole story: its definition from `refdata/strategies.db` (`-ref`), the current definition against any swept config side by side with the changed parameters highlighted (click a row of the sweep table to compare it), every parameter combination the sweep tried, the optimizer's `params_json` with in/out-of-sample results, and every other table that holds the id. The bar-level tables (`trades`, `equity_curve`, `signals`) open filtered to the strategy.

**Top ETFs.** The sidebar's *Top ETFs* lists the largest ETFs (top 50 to 300) with how many strategies, and how many streak strategies, are tied to each, and how many of those are in the run. A row opens that symbol's strategies with the run's CAGR, Sharpe, drawdown, trades and win rate where it has them. The repo has no AUM or market-cap data, so "largest" is average daily dollar volume (close × volume) over the last 90 daily bars of the market database (`-db`), for the active ETFs in `refdata/universe.db` (`-universe`); leveraged funds are left out unless ticked, and common stocks the universe marks as ETFs are dropped. Replace `sql/stages/runview/01_top_etfs.sql` if you get a real AUM list.

Keys: `/` jumps to search, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter runs the SQL, double-click a cell to copy it.

## validate

Is the strategy real or overfit? Walks it through rolling train / test folds (24 months in sample, 6 out, step 6), then prints a verdict per strategy: `HOLDS`, `DECAYS`, `CURVE_FIT`, or `INSUFFICIENT`.

```bash
./bin/validate -keep-going -strategy streak-googl-down3,googl_tree    # folds, then the verdict
./bin/validate walk -strategy streak-googl-down3                       # only the folds
./bin/validate verdict -run-id 12 -strategy streak-googl-down3         # only the verdict, from run 12
```

**Reads:** `data/market_history.db`, table `backtest_start`.

**Writes:** `walk_forward.db` (`walk_forward_fold`, `walk_forward_summary`, and `check_overfit_gate` with the gates) in a run folder, `data/reports/<run_id>/`. `-run-id N` goes into run N. Without it the folds start a new run and a verdict alone uses the latest. `-db` names a file instead. `-strategy` is required for the folds, and for a verdict it limits the output to those ids.

Folds: train 24 months, test 6, step 6 (`-train-months`, `-test-months`, `-step-months`), capital `$100,000`. It registers the same strategies as `backtest` and walks them one at a time, not as a stack. `-keep-going` skips a strategy with too little history instead of stopping the list. `-market-db` lets a run use a copy of the market DB that ends before a held-out period.

Verdict gates: `-min-oos-trades 8`, `-trial-cutoff 20`, `-decay 0.25`. A streak strategy has one trial, so it is never `CURVE_FIT` however many were screened. After screening thousands on the same data, add a stricter gate such as `sql/search/01_gate_walk_forward.sql`.

`walk_forward` and `check_overfit` still work as the two halves (`validate walk`, `validate verdict`) and print a deprecation note. The logic stays in `pkg/walk_forward` and `pkg/check_overfit`.

---

## universe

Discover US stocks and ETFs from Polygon and the Nasdaq lists, and classify them (leverage, direction, category, first trade date, whether history reaches 2021).

**Writes:** `refdata/universe.db`, table `universe` (about 13,500 rows). Needs `POLYGON_API_KEY` or `-polygon-key` for the Polygon part.

```bash
./bin/universe
./bin/universe -etfs-only -max-checks 200
./bin/universe -refresh               # look every symbol up again
```

Each run fetches the symbol lists, then looks up only the symbols it has not settled. A symbol with a stored first trade date is skipped, since that date never changes, and one that could not be verified is tried again after `-retry-days` (7). A run with nothing new makes no Yahoo requests. `-refresh` looks up everything again.

Flags: `-db`, `-polygon-key`, `-workers 16`, `-limit 1000`, `-max-checks 0`, `-etfs-only`, `-stocks-only`, `-refresh`, `-retry-days 7`.

### universe reclassify

Relabels `leverage` and `direction` of every stored symbol from its stored name with the current classifier, with no network calls. `-dry-run` lists the changes without saving. Run it after the name rules in `pkg/universe` change; `universe` itself only classifies the symbols it looks up.

```bash
./bin/universe reclassify -dry-run
./bin/universe reclassify
```

### universe avgvol

Average daily share volume (ADTV) of every symbol in the market database, over one or more trailing windows of daily bars.

```bash
./bin/universe avgvol                 # 20-day window
./bin/universe avgvol -days 20,60     # two windows
```

**Reads:** `data/market_history.db` (`-market-db`), table `backtest_start`, daily bars only.

**Writes:** table `avg_volume` in `refdata/universe.db` (`-db`): `symbol`, `window_days`, `avg_volume`, `bars_used`, `first_date`, `last_date`, `computed_at`, one row per symbol and window. A symbol with fewer bars than the window is averaged over the bars it has and `bars_used` says how many. A rerun replaces the rows of the windows it computes and leaves other windows alone. The calculation is SQL (`sql/stages/avgvol`): a slice table `avgvol_window_bars` of each symbol's last N bars, then the average. Join to `universe` on `symbol` to filter by liquidity.

## train

`train <family> [flags] [symbols]` trains a strategy family's model and saves it in SQLite. `backtest` only reads a saved model; it never trains one, so run this first, and again when the market data has advanced. Every model trains on the daily bars in `data/market_history.db`, and the command prints the last bar date it trained through.

| Family | Result |
|---|---|
| `markov` | trains the per-symbol Markov regime model into `data/markov_models.db` (`markov_prediction`, `markov_model_meta`) |
| `tree` | trains a depth-3 CloudForest decision tree per signal symbol into `data/tree_models.db` (`tree_node`, `tree_model_meta`) |
| `streak`, `hold` | nothing to train: these strategies have no fitted model, their parameters are the row's columns in `refdata/strategies.db` |
| `all` | every family above, in name order |

`markov_hmm_*` strategies read `data/reports/hmm_regime.db`, which `study hmm_regime` writes; that is a study, not a `train` family.

**markov.** A bar is bull at +5% or more over 20 bars, bear at -5% or less, otherwise sideways. For each date the model stores the walk-forward chance that the next bar is bull or bear, using only transitions known by that date. The calculation is SQL (`sql/stages/markov_train`, one slice table per stage). **Reads:** `data/market_history.db`, and `refdata/strategies.db` (`markov_strategy.signal_symbol`) when no symbols are given. Symbols already in the model are replaced. A symbol with fewer than 21 bars gets no model. A markov strategy whose signal symbol has no model produces no signals and logs which `train markov` command to run.

**tree.** Each bar is labelled with the next bar's return in 5 buckets: class -2 at or below -5%, -1 above -5% and below -1%, 0 from -1% to 1% inclusive, 1 above 1% and below 5%, 2 at or above 5%. The features are 13 values per bar (returns over 1, 3, 5 and 10 bars, RSI, distance from the 20, 50 and 200 bar averages, volume ratio, range against ATR, close within the day's range, consecutive down closes), calculated in SQL by `sql/stages/tree_features`. The neutral class usually dominates, so the tree is grown on every bar of the four other classes plus an evenly spaced sample of neutral bars no larger than the biggest of those four, with the classes weighted to balance the grown set. A symbol needs 250 labelled bars (the first 200 bars of history are warm-up) and at least 10 bars of class 2, otherwise it is skipped and the reason is printed. The tree is stored one row per node, addressed by CloudForest's L/R path from the root. A `tree_strategy` row buys its trade symbol on every bar the saved tree of its signal symbol predicts class 2; a row whose signal symbol has no saved tree produces no signals and logs which `train tree` command to run. Its `coil_range_max`, `sma_bounce_min` and `sma_bounce_max` columns are no longer read (role `legacy` in `strategy_family_param`). **Reads:** `data/market_history.db`, and `refdata/strategies.db` (`tree_strategy.signal_symbol`) when no symbols are given. The last bar of a symbol has no next return, so it is scored but not trained on: the "through" date printed is the last labelled bar.

```bash
./bin/train markov                      # every signal_symbol in markov_strategy
./bin/train markov GOOGL AAPL           # just these
./bin/train markov -symbols GOOGL,AAPL -batch 100
./bin/train tree MARA NVDL             # just these
./bin/train streak                      # says there is nothing to train
```

Flags for `markov` and `tree` (`tree` has no `-batch`, and only `tree` has `-through <date>`, which trains on bars up to that date so the later months stay out of sample): `-db`, `-model-db`, `-ref-db`, `-symbols`, `-batch 200`, `-calc-dir` (keep the last batch's slice tables).

## stratlist

Run a SELECT from a `.sql` file against `refdata/strategies.db` and print the first column (the strategy id) of each row. Duplicates and blanks are dropped; the DB is opened query-only. Examples are in `sql/lists/`.

```bash
./bin/stratlist sql/lists/sample_100_per_table.sql          # one id per line
./bin/backtest -strategy "$(./bin/stratlist -comma sql/lists/sample_100_per_table.sql)"
```

Flags: `-db` (default `refdata/strategies.db`), `-sql` (or give the file as the first argument), `-comma`.

## strategy

Print every strategy that has its own `sql/strategies` pipeline, then a row count per strategies.db table. Rows are not listed one by one. No flags.

```bash
./bin/strategy
```

### strategy derive

Add a rotation strategy that is a copy of an existing one with the parameter set of a sweep result. The parameter set is the label `gridsearch` prints, alone or inside the whole result line.

**Writes:** one new row in `refdata/strategies.db` table `rotation_strategy`.

```bash
./bin/strategy derive -from rotation-2x-sector-pairs-daily-limit90 \
  -id rotation-2x-sector-pairs-daily-limit95-tp3-sl3 -name "2x Sector Pairs Daily 95% Limit TP3 SL3" \
  "#1  Period-1d/Limit-95%/Hold-2d/TP+3%/SL-3%   Profit=+$258505.67  CAGR=37.73%"
```

| Flag | Default |
|---|---|
| `-from` | required: the rotation strategy id to copy |
| `-params` | the parameter set, or bare arguments after the flags |
| `-position-pct` | none. The size of each position as a fraction of portfolio value for a `pick = all` row (`0.20` is 20%); it sets `allocation_pct` and `max_weight_pct` together. Alone it copies the row with only that change, and the parameter set becomes optional |
| `-id` | the source id without its `-limit..` suffix, then `-limit95-tp3-sl3-hold2` (and the period when it is not `1d`) |
| `-name` | the source name with the parameter set |
| `-ref` | `refdata/strategies.db` |

The copy sets the period, buy limit, hold days, take profit and stop from the label and keeps every other column, the symbol list by its `symbol_lists` id included. The label holds whole percents (the sweep prints `%.0f`). An id that exists, an unknown source, or a parameter set the row cannot run (a stop of 100%) is refused and writes nothing. The command prints the `backtest` line to run it.

### strategy export

Write a small reference database holding only the rows of the named strategies, for a program that cannot carry the 65,000-row `refdata/strategies.db`.

```bash
./bin/strategy export -ids "streak-voo-buy-tecl+markov_model_amd+markov_model_lite+markov_model_mull" \
  -out ../trade_orchestrator/pkg/strategies/deploy/strategies.db
```

`-ids` takes strategy ids and `a+b+c` stacks, comma-separated. Every id must be a row in `streak_strategy`, `tree_strategy`, `hold_strategy` or `markov_strategy`, or the command fails and names the ones that are not. `-src` chooses the full database. `trade_orchestrator` embeds the output and reads it where it has no reference database.

A strategy that needs something built from the bars before it can signal implements `strategy.Preparer`, and a live scan (`livescan`, `runner.RunLiveScan`) calls it after refreshing the bars. `markov_strategy` trains its signal symbol through the latest bar when its saved model is behind, because the model holds one prediction per date and has none for a session it was not trained through. A failed `Prepare` stops the scan with `PREPARE_FAILED`, and a missing model never passes as "no signal".

## prune_losers

Remove what does not earn its place. `-dry-run` on every mode reports without changing anything.

```bash
./bin/prune_losers -dry-run                       # strategies whose latest backtest has win_rate < 0.5 (or no trades)
./bin/prune_losers untrainable -dry-run           # tree strategies and models that cannot be trained before the holdout cutoff
./bin/prune_losers symbols -strategy rotation-2x-sector-pairs-daily-limit95-tp3-sl3 -dry-run
```

The first two delete rows from `refdata/strategies.db`.

### prune_losers symbols

Take the losing names out of a rotation strategy's symbol list. A name is a loser only when all three hold: it lost money in the in-sample backtest, it lost money in the held-out backtest, and it won fewer than `-min-win-rate` (default `0.4`) of its trades over both windows. A name with no trades in either window is never removed. The results are the strategy's latest run in a run folder, `rotation.db` (in-sample) and `oos/rotation.db` (held out), the latest folder holding both unless `-run-id N` names one.

The strategy is pointed at a new symbol list, the old id plus `-pruned` (`etf-2x-sector-pairs` becomes `etf-2x-sector-pairs-pruned`). The list it used is not changed, because other strategies may use it. A strategy with a literal ticker list has the names removed from that list. Run the strategy's `backtest` again to see the effect; the result files of the earlier run still hold the removed names, and the command prints the table it decided from.

## transaction_calc

Turn an Interactive Brokers transaction-history CSV into the same performance report the backtester uses.

**Writes:** `data/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<csv name>.html`.

```bash
./bin/transaction_calc -in data/U22262325.TRANSACTIONS.1Y.csv
```

### transaction_calc account

Rebuild the account day by day and measure it like a claimed performance table. Reads the statement, optionally a tab-separated claimed table (`Timeframe`, `Total`, `CAR`, `Max Drawdown`, `Calmar Ratio`, `Avg CAR`, `Avg MDD`, `Avg Trades/Year`), and the daily bars in the market database.

```bash
./bin/transaction_calc account -in data/U22262325.TRANSACTIONS.1Y.csv \
  -claim "data/ibkr_claim_performance_nas100,TopTech&RUSS3000.txt" -db data/ibkr_2025oct_2026_oct.db
```

**Writes** to `-db`: `ibkr_transactions` (the statement rows), `claimed_performance`, and slice tables from `sql/stages/ibkr_account` in order: `ibkr_calendar`, `ibkr_cash_running`, `ibkr_position_daily`, `ibkr_equity_daily`, `ibkr_return_daily` (time-weighted, deposits and withdrawals are not returns), `ibkr_actual_performance` and `ibkr_claim_vs_actual`. Fills priced on an old split basis are put on the bars' basis, and a symbol with no bars is marked at its last fill. `-market-db` and `-calendar` (default VOO) choose the bars and the trading days. See [docs/OneYearComparison.md](docs/OneYearComparison.md) for the comparison it produced.

## markov_test

Print the empirical bear / sideways / bull transition matrix and tomorrow's probabilities for GOOGL (20-day return, plus or minus 5% thresholds). No flags, no writes. See [docs/MarkovModel.md](docs/MarkovModel.md).

```bash
./bin/markov_test
```

## Stack candidates skill

`.claude/skills/stack-candidates/` is a Claude Code skill that runs `train`, `backtest`, `gridsearch` and `strateval` as needed and reports the 20 best strategies across all families to try in a stack. `top_strategies.sh <run_dir> [n]` does the ranking on its own: the lower of in-sample and held-out Calmar, with gates on trades, profit and held-out drawdown, one strategy per trade symbol and at most 8 per family.
