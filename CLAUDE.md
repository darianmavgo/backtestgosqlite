# backtestgosqlite (BT)

Go backtester. Bars, signals, trades and reports live in SQLite. Module `github.com/darianmavgo/backtestgosqlite`, pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no cgo).

The cross-repo rules (ownership, one implementation for CLI/web/GAE, naming, no mocks) are in `../CLAUDE.md` and apply here in full. This file holds only what is specific to BT. Read `README.md` for command usage and `Architecture.md` for the package map; do not duplicate them here.
## Tool Swaps
replace sed with sd
replace find with fd
replace grep with rg

## Commands

Run from the repo root so `.env` and default paths resolve.

```bash
make build            # every cmd/* into bin/
make test             # go test ./pkg/... ./cmd/...
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...   # required before saying it works
go test ./pkg/strategy -run TestName              # one test
./bin/backtest -strategylist                              # registered strategy ids
```

- Flags go before positional args (Go `flag` stops at the first bare arg). A subcommand is arg 1: `backtest stack -primary ...`.
- `data/market_history.db` (table `backtest_start`) and `refdata/strategies.db` are real data. Tests and experiments must not write to them; use `t.TempDir()` databases or `data/reports/`. For a search or experiment on trimmed data, build a copy of the market DB and pass `-db` (and `-out-dir`).
- Paths come from `pkg/appenv`. Only `APP_FOLDER` is configurable; `data/`, `refdata/` and `data/reports/` are fixed subfolders (`APP_DATA`, `APP_REF` and `APP_REPORTS` no longer exist). Do not hardcode `data/...` or `reports/...` in Go, including flag defaults; call `appenv.MarketDB()`, `appenv.ReportFile(name)` or `cliutils.GetDefaultMarketDB`.
- `go vet ./...` currently fails: `pkg/backtest/main_test.go:53` calls `strategy.NewSigVooBuyTecl`, which was removed (it is now the `streak-voo-buy-tecl` row). `pkg/runner` stack tests also look up the removed `sig-voo-buy-tecl`. Fix these before relying on a green `go test ./...`.

## Layout rules

- Signals are calculated in SQL and Go only runs them: a strategy builds its config, calls `strategy.RunPipeline` with a `sql/strategies/<name>/` directory and returns the result. Do not add a Go loop over bars that decides entries, and do not add an indicator function in Go.

- `cmd/<name>/main.go` is a thin main that calls `pkg/<name>.Main` / `Run`. Flags, defaults and logic live in `pkg/<name>` so tests call `Run` without `os.Args`. Follow `pkg/backtest/main.go` and `pkg/livescan/main.go`.
- `pkg/strategy` holds the `Strategy` interface and registry (`Register`, `RegisterAlias`, `Get`; lookup is case- and punctuation-insensitive). Keys differ by `-`/`_`, so do not add a second id that normalizes to an existing one.
- Row-backed strategies (streak, hold, tree, markov) are not registered per row. Each table is one `strategy.Family` (`pkg/strategy/family.go`, `RowFamily`); `strategy.Get(id)` reads and builds the row on demand, with the same case/punctuation-insensitive match. `strategy.List()` returns only the strategies with their own pipeline; `strategy.ListAll()` also builds every row (use it only where "all" must mean every row). `pkg/stratreg.RegisterAll(root, db)` registers SQL pipelines plus the families; commands that only need the families call `stratreg.RegisterFamilies()`. Never loop over a table calling `strategy.Register`. Pick subsets with `stratlist` and a `.sql` file (`sql/lists/`).
- Every strategy is SQL controlled by Go. Most (about 65,600) are rows in `refdata/strategies.db` (`streak_strategy`, `hold_strategy`, `tree_strategy`, `markov_strategy`). Add or change those with SQL on the table, not Go. `etf_universe` is empty and the `etf_dt_strategies` / `dt_*` handling was deleted; the tree family is the one decision-tree family.
- `park-<symbol>` (`strategy.ParkStrategy`) is a stack member for the residual-cash book. It is never a sleeve: `strategy.SplitResidual` removes it and the runner passes its symbol as `DefaultAsset`. Do not give it signals.
- Other packages: `simulator` (portfolio and shared-account), `runner` (load bars, run, stack), `storage` (schemas, `OpenSQLite`, `ExecuteSQLFile`), `refdb` (strategies.db), `analytics` (metrics, HTML tear sheet), `calendar`, `transaction_calc` (IBKR CSV to report), `universe` (Polygon discovery into `refdata/universe.db`), `validate` (walk-forward folds and overfit verdict, built on `walk_forward` and `check_overfit`).
- `sql/search/` holds the stack-search gate and liquidity screen as numbered slice-table stages. Run them with `sqlite3` against the walk-forward, market and settings DBs; there is no Go wrapper yet.
- Trained models stay out of `backtest`: `train markov` writes `data/markov_models.db` and `train tree` writes `data/tree_models.db`; strategies only read them (and log the train command when a model is missing). Do not move fitting back into a strategy or pipeline. Any new strategy family that learns something gets its own `train <family>` entry with the same shape.
- `cmd/markov_test` and `cmd/transaction_calc` hold logic in `cmd/`, which breaks the thin-wrapper rule. Move that logic into `pkg/` when touching them.

## Adding or changing a strategy

1. Implement `strategy.Strategy` in `pkg/strategy/<id>.go` and register it (see `price_action_reclaim.go` for the newest example).
2. Put the signal math in `sql/strategies/<id>/` as ordered files (`01_schema.sql`, `02_calc_....sql`, ...), one stage per file, each writing a slice table. `GenerateSignals` runs them in name order.
3. The output table needs `idx, symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume, buylimit, entry`; rows with `entry = 1` become entries. See `sql/strategies/README.md`.
4. Add a test using a real temp SQLite DB with literal bars. No mocks or fakes.
5. If the Go side needs a new indicator, write it as SQL instead of extending `strategy/indicators.go` or `decisiontree.go`.

SQL files are embedded via `sql/embed.go`; rebuild after editing them.

## Rule 5: Signals use absolute prices

In `models.Signal`, `TakeProfit` and `StopLoss` are absolute dollar prices (`150.00`), never multipliers (`0.95`) or percentages (`0.10`). A percentage passed as a price triggers instantly on the next tick. To use the configured fallback (`TakeProfitPct`, etc.), leave the field `0`; the simulator applies it to the real entry price.

## Data gotchas

- `backtest` and `backtest stack` hold out the last 12 months by default (`pkg/backtest/holdout.go`: in-sample pass, then one out-of-sample pass into `data/reports/oos/`). Tests or tooling that need a single full-history pass must pass `-holdout-months 0`; single-strategy result DBs otherwise cover only the in-sample window.
- Walk-forward and stack results depend on the market DB window: a stack found by screening many strategies on the full history is in-sample. Keep a held-out final period and report it separately (see `docs/omnifunds_benchmark.md` for the bar to beat).
- Daily simulation reads rows with `length(Date) = 10`; minute bars share the same table and are skipped.
- Result DBs are written per run: `data/reports/<id>.db`, then `<id>_2.db`, `<id>_3.db`. Do not assume a fixed filename.
- `strateval`'s ledger is `strategies.db` in the run folder (`-run-id`); `STRATEGIES_DB`, then `STRATEVAL_DB`, override it. `walk_forward.db` and `gridsearch.db` also live in the run folder, so a run never sees another run's results.
- `data/` (except `README.md` and `ignore_over50MB.sh`), `bin/` and `reports/*.html` are gitignored; `data/` also has its own `.git`. Do not commit databases or binaries.

## Before you finish

Run the checklist in `../CLAUDE.md`, plus: strategy ids registered and listed by `backtest -strategylist`; any new env var or flag is in `README.md`; `TakeProfit`/`StopLoss` are absolute or `0`.
